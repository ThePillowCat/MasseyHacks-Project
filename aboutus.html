  <h1 style="background-color:lightcoral;"> About Page</h1>
  <h2>This page contains some info about our website and its creators.</h2><br>

<p>This website was made using HTML and CSS, and the games were made using Javascript.<br> <br>We obtained a free domain and hosted it on netlify. (classicarcade.online)<br> We also hosted it on GitHub.<br><br></br>With more time, we would've added more games and fixed bugs. <br>In the future, we will work towards more complex games and <br>better website design.<br>
 <br> Our team has 4 members, Noah, Igor, Hugh, and Kevin.
  <br>We joined MasseyHacks to have fun and learn new things.<br>
